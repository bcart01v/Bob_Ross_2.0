# Ryan Notes

To run the project in it's current state, do the following

- `cd backend`
- `python app.py`

The backend will start at 'http://127.0.0.1:5005'

You can then open a web browser and enter `127.0.0.1:8000` and select `Front-facing` -> `index.html` or open the index.html directly from the projct folder

This is all very temporary, just getting the workflow down and main logic done, then we can stylize it.  
Adding some placeholder text so I (Ryan) can access the repo easily from my profile page.
